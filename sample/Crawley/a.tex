\section*{\textsl{Inheritance Diagram}}

Here, the Crawley family and their stories are borrowed from the
famous British TV series \textsl{Downton Abbey.}
I've just borrowed it just to show how to use this familytree package.

Under the fee tail or ``entail'', three daughters
cannot inherit the title and the estate of Lord Grantham's,
including the big amount of dowry Cora had brought.
The law requires a male heir.

Fortunately Robert has a cousin James Crawley, and his son Patrick.
They are good heir presumptive to the earldom.
Actually, but not officially, the eldest daughter Lady Mary is engaged
to Patrick so that the family will keep their assets.

In 1912, James and Patrick have perished in the sinking of Titanic,
and their body were not found. Not only Lady Mary lost her unofficial
fianc\'{e}, but also the family lost the male hier.

But Murray, Lord Grantham's lawyer discovered third cousin once
removed, Matthew Crawley who is a son of an upper-middle-class doctor.
Now Matthew has become the next heir presumptive.
